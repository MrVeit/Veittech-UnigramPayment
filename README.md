# Technical Demo

You can test the SDK without installation on the demo app [in Telegram bot](https://t.me/UnigramPayment_bot/launch).

# Dependencies

For the library to work correctly, the following dependencies **must be installed** in the project before use:
- **[Newtonsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6xkl_EsvQ)** - modern solution for convenient work with json files.

# Installation

[Download the latest version of the SDK via the .unityPackage file here](https://github.com/MrVeit/Veittech-UnigramPayment/releases).

# Initialization

Before you can use all the features of the SDK, you must initialize it in **one of two available ways**.

#### –êutomatic initialization:
The `UnigramPaymentSDK` component has an option called `Initialize On Awake`. When you activate it, the SDK will initialize automatically. You only need to subscribe to the necessary events and start working with it.

#### Manual initialization:
Below is a test example of how it can look like.
